        A decade ago, we set out to bring cooks together from all over to
        exchange recipes and to support each other in the kitchen. We wanted to
        create a buzzing place for others who do what we do all day long: talk
        about food! Since we started Food52 (we cook 52 weeks a year, get it?),
        tens of millions of cooks and eaters have found their way to the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Food52 you can find thousands of recipes submitted by our community
        and cooked by our editors in our very own test kitchens. Our recipes and
        articles are James Beard Award winning, our cookbooks are New York Times
        bestsellers, our Instagram is loved and followed by millions, and our
        community has grown to over 13 million people.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2013 we launched our shop to bring like-minded makers and artisans
        together with all of us. Today we curate the great things that allow you
        to cook and eat thoughtfully, and we have grown to include the home
        goods and crafts that support joyful living—and we have even started
        making some of these products with you! Great food isn't just about
        ingredients, it's about everything that makes a meal—it's the platter
        you serve tacos on; the composter in your kitchen; the knife you take on
        picnics. And joyful living goes beyond just the kitchen; it is the
        beeswax candles on your table, the wreath on your doorway, the linen
        throw that accents your couch.
      </p>
      <p>
        We envision Food52 as the one place you can see thousands of test
        kitchen-approved recipes, shop the kitchenware you need to make them,
        and discuss the results with like-minded people. That same destination
        can be the go to when you need a birthday gift for a food-obsessed
        friend. The place to look for great table linens. The place to
        window-shop and daydream. We depend on—and we look forward to—your
        ideas, feedback, and support. So get ready for some inspiration and come
        hang out!
      </p>
      <h3>We look forward to cooking with you!</h3>
