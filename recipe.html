          Whether you consider this a giant chocolate tart or chocolate custard
          cake, we will agree it is one of the most delicious desserts you will
          ever make. A cross between a chocolate mousse cake and a chocolate
          Flan Patissier, it is deeply chocolatey, ultra creamy, yet not overly
          rich, and shockingly straightforward to make. The perfect finale for
          any occasion!

        <h3>1. CHOCOLATE CUSTARD</h3>
        <div class="wrapper">
          <div class="content">
            This cake is made using crème pâtissière, a creamy custard that is
            used in many French desserts. The recipe I am using today is based
            on the custard used in the famous (giant!) French vanilla custard
            tart, Flan Pâtissier, with chocolate added. While exact recipes for
            crème pâtissière vary depending on the intended use (ie. baked vs
            not baked; required viscosity for pouring vs piping vs filling vs
            spreading, flavourings added etc), the base ingredients are almost
            always the same:

      <h3>2. MAKING THE CHOCOLATE CUSTARD:</h3>
      <p>
        Heat milk with vanilla and about half the sugar until just before
        boiling. You can just eyeball the amount of sugar that goes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whisk the egg yolks, remaining sugar and cornflour/cornstarch in a
        separate large bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whisk in milk – Slowly pour the hot milk in while whisking constantly,
        which will ensure the hot milk does not cook the eggs. Pour all the milk
        in and whisk until combined. This step by which hot liquid is poured in
        a controlled manner into cold eggs without causing them to cook is
        called tempering eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Precaution step: If the saucepan is a little heavy for you, just use a
        jug or ladle to assist. Once you get about 1 cup of of the milk whisked
        in, you do not need to worry about scrambling the eggs!
      </p>
      <p>
        Transfer the egg-milk mixture back into the saucepan. Now we are going
        to cook it for a few minutes until it thickens into a custard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thicken custard – Pour the egg-milk mixture back into the same saucepan.
        Place over medium low heat, whisking constantly so the base does not
        catch, until it starts to thicken (you will feel it). It should happen
        within 3 to 5 minutes. If it gets lumpy, remove off heat, whisk
        vigorously – will become smooth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lazy bubbles – The sight of lazy bubbles is the trigger that determines
        the right cook time for custard. They will start to appear once the
        custard is thickened, and it is hot and steamy. You will need to pause
        stirring for a few seconds to see if they appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stir 45 sec – Once you see the bubbles, whisk constantly on the stove
        for a further 45 seconds then remove from stove. The rule for making
        French custard is 30 seconds for every 500ml/2 cups of milk. That is,
        for every 2 cups of milk used in the custard, stir for 30 seconds after
        the bubbles start appearing. Because we are using 3 cups of milk, we
        stir for 45 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add chocolate – Remove from the stove, add chocolate and stir until
        fully melted. See below for what it looks like!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thickness – The custard should be thick enough such that it mounds
        slightly on the surface, like pictured above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Set aside – Transfer into a bowl, immediately cover with cling wrap
        touching the surface to prevent a skin from forming. If you can see
        lumps in your custard, feel free to strain through a fine mesh. Then set
        the custard aside while preparing the base. There is no need to rest
        chocolate custard overnight, like we do with the vanilla custard for
        Flan Pâtissier. Reason: Vanilla custard is more delicate and benefits
        from overnight flavour development. Chocolate custard does not need it.
        Make-ahead option – If you want to get ahead, the custard can be
        refrigerated overnight then used the next day.

              Blitz until they become fine crumbs. Add melted butter, then blitz
              again until combined.
            </p>
            <p>
              Transfer crumbs into prepared pan. Press evenly and firmly on to
              the base. I spread the crumbs with a spatula then use the
              underside of a straight-sided, flat-bottomed measuring cup to
              press them flat. But honestly, even your hands will do the job!

      <h3>4. BAKING</h3>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Whisk custard until smooth. It firms up as it cools but should still
            be warm by the time you get to using it. Though you can, as noted
            above, leave the custard overnight and finish the cake tomorrow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pour the custard into the prepared cake pan. Spread the custard and
            smooth the surface. No need to be too meticulous here as the custard
            will thin as it heats up and spread out evenly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bake for 1 hour at 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced), rotating the cake
            at the 45 minute mark. The cake will puff up towards the end and a
            thin (chocolatey!) skin will form on the surface. This is a
            signature characteristic of Flan Pâtissier (French Custard Tart) on
            which this recipe is based! The cake should still be wobbly when you
            pull it out of the oven. It firms up in the fridge.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <img
            src="https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chocolate-custard-cake_0.jpg"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Cool overnight – Remove the cake from the oven and leave to cool on the
        counter for at least 3 hours. Do not be alarmed if it deflates – that is
        what is supposed to happen! Then refrigerate for at least 12 hours, or
        even longer. If there is any hint of warmth in the cake when you put it
        in the fridge, do not cover the cake with cling wrap as it will make it
        sweat. Because of the type of cake this is, there is no risk of it
        drying out so just leave it uncovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remove the sides of the springform pan then slide the cake off the base
        (and feel smug at how easy it is because you learnt the inverted cake
        base trick!).
